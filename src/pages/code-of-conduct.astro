          Enforcement Responsibilities
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
          standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
          corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
          inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
          or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
          contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
          communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-brand-dark font-bold">Scope</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also
          applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
          public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
          official email address, posting via an official social media account,
          or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
          event.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-brand-dark font-bold">
          Enforcement
        </h2>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
          may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement
          at <span set:html={codeOfConductMain}></span>. At the start of the event,
          the organising team will be highlighted to the attendees. You can approach any of the
          team members if you feel uncomfortable or if you experience any issues.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          If, for whatever reason, you prefer another contact, feel free to
          contact <span set:html={codeOfConductSecondary}></span>, who will make sure to follow
          up with the people in question.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. If required,
          a member of the organising team will escort you from the venue, ensure that 
          you have a safe ride home, and contact the police.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
          security of the reporter of any incident.
