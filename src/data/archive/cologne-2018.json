This keynote from Xamarin Developer Advocate Jim Bennett covers where we are now with Xamarin development across classic, forms and the tooling, and takes a glimpse into where Xamarin will be going in the future.",

Afterwards, we'll tackle a small demo with the use of Akka.NET on a mobile app with Xamarin. The Actor Model provides a higher level of abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed systems. It alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent and parallel systems.",

Mobile app users can flick that 'airplane mode' switch any given time and the cellular connection isn't as stable as it is at home. To ensure a great user-experience you, as a developer, need to account for these scenarios. In this session I will show you how to use awesome libraries like Akavache and Polly to create connected apps in a very easy way.",

After all, isn't it the Garbage Collector's job to release unused or unreachable objects to free up memory? Pieter will investigate and try to find the culprits of different memory leaks, and their motives. This often requires a deep dive into some Xamarin/iOS/Android internals. After this session you should have a good understanding of how and why some types of memory leaks arise, how to search for them and how to avoid them in the future.",

Nowadays, there are many possible target platforms that will run .NET applications, from UWP or Windows Store to iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, or even Tizen. To not re-implement your app for every platform there are many different code sharing strategies: Portable Class Libraries, Shared Projects, File Linking, .NET Standard, .NET Core. The talk will give you all the information you need to make the technology decision for your next project, enabling you to maximize your code sharing.",

But thanks to an ever growing community effort you can easily expand your reach and target platforms such as WPF, macOS, Linux, your Samsung TV and even the web. Breaking out of a mobile only world comes with its own sets of challenges when it comes to the UI. During this session we will see how we can extend Xamarin Forms to target new platforms, scale your UI and avoid a UX nightmare.",
