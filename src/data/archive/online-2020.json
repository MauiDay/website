This enables the configuration of the UI at runtime.\r\n\r\nCan I bind my data to them?\r\nControl templates support template binding that allows data binding to the UI. This enables the control to present data bound to a binding context, and present different UIs for same data model.\r\n\r\nHow do they work?\r\nIn this session, we will go over the concept and examples of creating and consuming Control Templates. We will live code a responsive UI that is configured at runtime. You don’t want to miss it.",
