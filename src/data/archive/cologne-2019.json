Using VS App Center you can send notifications through the UI of VS App Center, but most importantly you have availability to send them from your backend using VS App Center REST API.

      "title": "MVVM async loading: free yourself from IsBusy = true",
      "description": "This session talks about the issue of using two much inheritance in the view models and brings technical solutions to solve this by composition.\r\n\r\nIt focus on the async loading of the view models and the handling of the result (error, empty state).\r\n\r\nThe target audience is MVVM/Xaml developers (UWP/WPF/Xamarin.Forms).\r\n\r\n## Common inheritance scenario\r\n\r\nWe'll start by seeing how the async loading view model initialization is done most of the time:\r\n\r\n### excerpts\r\n\r\n*So, here is our shameless initialization code (spoiler alert: this is wrong).*\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic async void Initialize(object parameter)\r\n{\r\n  await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*This is a little better:*\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic async void Initialize(object parameter)\r\n{\r\n  try\r\n  {\r\n    await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);\r\n  }\r\n  catch (Exception exception)\r\n  {\r\n    ExceptionHandler.Handle(exception);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n*But wait, I want to give a UI feedback to the user:*\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic async void Initialize(object parameter)\r\n{\r\n  IsBusy = true;\r\n  HasErrors = false;\r\n  try\r\n  {\r\n    await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);\r\n  }\r\n  catch (Exception exception)\r\n  {\r\n    ExceptionHandler.Handle(exception);\r\n    HasErrors = true;\r\n    ErrorMessage =\r\n  }\r\n  finally\r\n  {\r\n    IsBusy = false;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Pfew, this is a lot of copy paste on each of my VM, I will create a base VM for this, and all my VM will inherit from that.*\r\n\r\n*Then stop it, stop that nonsense. Just use Composition over Inheritance.*\r\n\r\n## Compostion\r\n\r\nWe'll compare this code to the use of a component responsible for the view model state management:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic ViewModelLoader < ObservableCollection < SillyDudeVmo > >\r\nSillyPeopleLoader { get; }\r\n\r\npublic void Initialize(object parameter)\r\n{\r\nSillyPeopleLoader.Load(LoadSillyPeopleAsync);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### NotifyTask\r\n\r\nThen we will deconstruct the ViewModelLoader object piece by piece to show its true nature:\r\n\r\n#### excerpts\r\n\r\n*The ViewModelLoader is built around A Task wrapper implementing INotifyPropertyChanged: the NotifyTask.*\r\n\r\n*This component has been created by Stephen Cleary years ago (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx).*\r\n\r\n*It handles all the common states of a ViewModel loading:*\r\n\r\n1. Loading\r\n2. Success\r\n3. Empty state\r\n4. Error (and all sub exceptions with a ErrorHandler: Func < Exception, string >)\r\n5. Refresh\r\n\r\n*So instead of giving to a parent view model the responsibility to handle all these for us, we just create a reusable component to do so, achieving a clearer architecture.*\r\n\r\n## The View side\r\n\r\nWe'll then finish by a showcase of a component I wrote for Xamarin.Forms:\r\n\r\n### excerpts\r\n\r\n*The TaskLoaderView (https://www.sharpnado.com/taskloaderview-async-init-made-easy/) is the natural brother of the ViewModelLoader: you bind a ViewModelLoader to a TaskLoaderView.*\r\n\r\n*This component removes the async initialization pain from the view models (try catch / async void / IsBusy / IsInitialized / base view models / ...), and the IsVisible properties from the Views, by using Composition.*\r\n\r\n*Now prepare to be be dazzled!*\r\n\r\n*Dazzling demo*\r\n\r\nClap, clap, clap.\r\nTHE END.",

Smartwatches are seeing major adoption on the streets and they do not seem to be \"just a fad\". But... are they ready to be used in industrial environments? Will the factory-worker of the future have this companion on his/her wrist or will it be stuck in the consumer-only market forever?\r\n\r\nTo jump with both feet into the future, we challenged ourselves to build a stand-alone smartwatch app for WearOS and Tizen to support factory workers in a construction plant. Xamarin being our framework of choice. \r\n\r\nFrom the start, this project raised a ton of questions:\r\n\r\n- How do we connect the application to all the machines we got?\r\n- What tweaks you need to make the battery last a full 8-hour shift?\r\n- How to stop the app from getting killed by the OS?\r\n- How do we make sure employees can not use the watch to surf the web?\r\n- Can we provision 100s of devices in a quick and simple way?\r\n- ... and many more.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk we will answer all these questions, show you our setup and architecture for the project and give you our view on the future of \"smartwatches for industry 4.0\".",
