We will look at credentials and how we can keep the user authenticated even without having to ask for credentials over and over. So let's make sure your authentication security is just as pleasing to your customer as the rest of the app.\r\n",

Anything else, and we’re likely doing it wrong. \r\n\r\nLet’s explore two rather popular design patterns – MVVM & MVU, and pitch them against each other. .NET mobile/desktop stacks prefer MVVM, web technologies like Blazor/JS SPA are more natural fits with MVU, and .NET MAUI welcomes both. How much of the design pattern is open to interpretation? How much is baked in, when do you bring in frameworks and how is the tooling/ecosystem? This will be an honest fight for developer productivity – you game?\r\n",
