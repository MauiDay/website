You as the collective audience will be able to choose the paths that we go down and influence the content that gets presented.\r\n\r\nLearn through our own voting system how we can combine technology such as SignalR to provide real time multi-player support into our .NET MAUI based games as well as many other cool techniques to really make our games or applications feel alive.\r\n",
