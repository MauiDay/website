From there, we’ll look at how user feedback and activity results are captured, processed, and presented within the app.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also walk through the configuration and device‑management features available in the Settings area, highlighting how these support both everyday use and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nFinally, we’ll cover the build and deployment pipeline, including how GitHub Actions is used to produce Android and iOS builds and deliver them to the respective app stores for testing.\r\n\r\n⭐\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Building apps for real clients has a way of stripping theory back to what actually works. Patterns that look flexible and elegant at the start can quietly accumulate complexity, while the absence of clear constraints leaves teams exposed to subtle but expensive mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I’ll share lessons learned from delivering .NET MAUI apps as part of full-stack enterprise solutions. The focus is not on introducing new patterns, but on understanding where familiar ones succeed, where they fail, and how much opinion is actually required to make them sustainable.\r\n\r\nWe’ll look at:\r\n\r\n* Why unopinionated MVVM often leads to fragile state, inconsistent behaviour, and hard-to-reason-about UIs\r\n* Treating navigation, state, and UI consistency as systems, not incidental implementation details\r\n* Using constraints deliberately to remove decisions and reduce margin for error\r\n* Building high-walled, opinionated client architectures that guide teams toward the pit of success\r\n* The trade-offs involved, and the mistakes I’ve made along the way\r\n\r\nThis is an experience-driven talk for developers building client applications that need to integrate cleanly with enterprise backends, ship on real timelines, and stay maintainable long after the first release.",

      "description": ".NET MAUI apps come packed with powerful features out of the box - offline capabilities, GPS, Bluetooth, and more. These apps are typically distributed via app stores, which ensures offline functionality once installed. However, updating such apps usually requires pushing a new version through the store.\r\n\r\nBut what if we could make our apps dynamic - capable of adapting to backend-driven data - without sacrificing the benefits of store distribution?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore different techniques to build .NET MAUI apps that are flexible, dynamic, and driven entirely by runtime data. You’ll learn how to architect your app to update its content and behavior based on backend responses, all while maintaining the reliability and native experience of a traditionally deployed app.",
