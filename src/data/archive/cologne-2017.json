With doing so, you can now determine what your users are looking at and even how they are feeling and use that to enhance your functionality. \"Come with me if you want to live!\"",

Nothing more frustrating to get out of the reading flow and switch your focus to the IDE while trying the code samples. Thanks to Xamarin Workbooks, this is now something of the past! Workbooks enables live documentation, meaning you can read the tutorial and have code sampling directly integrated in the learning environment. During this session, we'll show you how to use and create Workbooks to help users engage and interact more with your tutorial or samples.",

My goal is it to give developers with intermediate knowledge of Xamarin Forms development and experienced ones without experience with the Rx World a good impression what it can do for you in your daily live to get the motivation to start with Reactive Programming. This won't be a introduction that goes deep into the details of Rx or ReactiveUI but a presentation and explanation of real-world code examples that are easy to follow.",

He will start of simple with a local data storage example, but will quickly change gears and show you where Realm really shines: connecting to a remote Realm Object Server, building a realtime collaboration app that does realtime data synchronisation, creating serverless functions that get triggered when data is pushed to the remote data store. And what about offline capabilities, networking code, conflict resolution? Don't you worry about that! After this session you won't believe how easy it is to build these kind of complex looking things with Realm in no time!",
